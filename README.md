## General info

The purpose of this site is to create a easy and well coded game in JavaScript. The HTML and CSS is easy to read and understand. The game itself is a widely know hand game called "Rock, paper, Scissors". The game is very easy to understand, you pick one hand sign of rock paper or scissors and show your opponent at the same time. Rock beats scissos, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock.

This page is a milestone project to become a Full Stack Developer. The course is provided by [Code Inistitute](https://codeinstitute.net/).
